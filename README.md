# Bloob Haus

> *Bloob Haus is the place where any markdown becomes an interactive, embeddable digital object — and where anyone can extend the catalog of what's possible.*

Existing tools such as Obsidian Publish host your vault. Bloob Haus turns your notes into portable visual objects and lets the world add new ways to see them.

**Live sites built with Obsidian to Webpage builder (still under construction but good for getting the idea):**
- [buffbaby.bloob.haus](https://buffbaby.bloob.haus) — Buff Baby Kitchen (recipes)
- [leons.bloob.haus](https://leons.bloob.haus) — Leon's Marbles (notes, thoughts, creative work)

## What this is

Bloob Haus is a personal web-home builder and an experiment in making **visual interfaces easy to create, share, and reproduce**.

The deeper vision: what if building a beautiful, interactive page was as easy as writing a few lines in a text file? What if you could hand someone a visualizer — a scene, a graph, a custom layout — and they could drop it into their own site and start shaping it immediately, with a live GUI, no code required?
(the vision goes deeper than this, but I am keeping myself short here)

The name comes from *Bauhaus* the idea that design and daily life should be integrated, not kept separate, and *Bloob*, which is my partner's design language for cute things and characters. A "haus" is your home on the web. In this context, a "bloob" is a real object on the web: asoft, shapeable thing — not a brand, not a product, just a place.

That's what this is building toward. The current architecture has three core concepts:

### Marbles
In my world, a marble is a metaphorical container for a note that I want to share and shape with you. It can be a sketchy idea, an insight, a piece of knowledge, or a question that I consider valuable for my life's ongoing dialogue. These marbles are never perfect and always a snapshot of a given moment.  [leons.bloob.haus/marbles](https://leons.bloob.haus)  as an example of my "marbles" collection. 

### Visualizers

Self-contained interactive components that live inside your markdown as code fences. You write:

~~~markdown
```scene-nav
aspectRatio: "16/9"
elements:
  - image: ![](/media/dragonfly.png)
    x: 66
    y: 4
    label: "dragonfly"
    glow: "#B388FF"
    action: link
    value: "https://studio.bloob.haus/"
```
~~~

And the site renders a full interactive scene with draggable elements, glow shadows, mobile/desktop positioning, and clickable links. Each visualizer is a self-contained package — its own parser, renderer, browser-side logic, styles, and tests. Same parser code runs at build time, in the browser preview, and (eventually) as an Obsidian plugin.

Current visualizers: interactive link graph, tag cloud, scene navigator.

#### GOOD EXAMPLES OF WORKING AND INTEGRATED VISUALIZERS ARE:

- [Fridge Magnets Visualization](https://leons.bloob.haus/marbles/FRIDGE-MAGNETS-FOR-GAS-BURNER-AWARENESS/)
- [PNG based interface that is highly customizable](https://leons.bloob.haus/say-hello-to/the-core-family-of-studio-bloob/)

### Magic Machines

Standalone browser tools — small apps that live at `/magic-machine/<name>/`. Some are builders that write code for you (the scene nav builder generates code fences you paste into Obsidian). Others are just useful interfaces that belong in a personal haus rather than a third-party app (the YouTube interface keeps you off the recommendation feed).

The point is that you shouldn't have to hand-write YAML to build something that looks and feels custom, and you shouldn't have to use addictive third-party interfaces to do simple things.

Adding a new magic machine is just: drop a folder in `lib/magic-machines/`, add a `manifest.json` with a `route` field, and the build pipeline picks it up automatically.

**Live magic machines:**
- [Scene Nav Builder](https://leons.bloob.haus/tools/scene-nav-builder/) — drag-and-drop builder for the scene-nav visualizer
- [YouTube Non-Addictive Interface](https://leons.bloob.haus/magic-machine/youtube-non-addictive-interface/) — distraction-free YouTube search and playback, your API key stays in your browser. Developed by [Adrian Botran](https://adrianfbotran.wixsite.com/portfolio).

## What this is (for non-technical readers)

Bloob Haus is a small piece of infrastructure that Leon and Whitney are building for their own digital lives. It turns private Obsidian notebooks into real websites — with interactive visuals, backlinks between pages, search, and custom themes.

The goal is to make something that feels genuinely personal, not like a template. Each page can declare what *kind of thing* it is (a marble, a note, a letter, a piece of art) and gets a matching banner image, colors, and icon. Links between pages show you what type of thing you're linking to. Scenes can be laid out with characters and objects, clicking through to products or other pages.

It started as a recipe site. It's grown into a platform for personal expression with real interactive interfaces.

## Values

**Your content stays yours.** Content lives in your own private GitHub repo. The builder clones it, transforms it, and deploys the site. You can walk away at any time and still have all your files.

**Consent-first publishing.** Nothing goes public by accident. You either tag things `#not-for-public` (blocklist mode) or explicitly mark them `publish: true` (allowlist mode). The filter runs before anything else.

**No surveillance, no tracking.** No analytics that follow people. No cookies that require banners. Just a static site hosted on Cloudflare.

**Build what you actually need.** The architecture evolves session by session based on real use, not hypothetical features. If it's not needed yet, it isn't built.

**Legible structure.** Folder = URL. Filename = stable identity. The site map follows the shape of your notes, not an algorithm.

## The journey so far

The project started in January 2026 as a Hugo site for Leon's recipes. Within a week it became clear that the vision was bigger — visualizers that work both on the web *and* inside Obsidian, backlinks between notes, interactive graphs. Hugo uses Go templates; those couldn't be shared with a browser. So the whole thing was migrated to Eleventy (JavaScript), which made it possible to use the same parsing code everywhere.

Since then:

- **Multi-site builder** — One codebase, multiple sites. Each site has its own YAML config, its own theme, its own content repo.
- **`marbles-pouch` theme** — Leon's personal theme: white banner, sky-blue body, organic wave separator, bloob-object type system. Each page declares what kind of thing it is (a marble, a note, a letter) and gets a matching visual identity.
- **Visualizers** — Modular interactive components that live inside your markdown as code fences. Currently: an interactive link graph, a tag cloud, and the scene navigator.
- **Scene Navigator** — Place images at positions on a canvas, give them glow effects and labels, link them to pages or URLs. Works on both desktop and mobile with independent positioning. Comes with a [drag-and-drop GUI builder](https://leons.bloob.haus/magic-machine/scene-nav-builder/).
- **Internal link pills** — Wiki-links and markdown links in your content are automatically styled as pills with the target page's bloob-object icon, so you can see at a glance what kind of thing you're linking to.
- **Bloob objects** — A registry (`_bloob-objects.md`) that maps object types (marble, note, letter, pouch…) to images, banner text, and descriptions. Declares what kinds of things exist in your haus.
- **Image pipeline** — Banner images, OG images, inline icons, favicon — all generated and optimized from one source image per object type.
- **Private content that stays private** — The publish filter now loads directly from the vault settings file, so there's no way to accidentally expose private content by running a script in the wrong order.

## How it works

```
Your Obsidian vault (private GitHub repo)
    ↓
Preprocessor:
  - filter out private content
  - resolve [[wiki-links]] and images
  - parse visualizer code fences
  - build graph.json link map
    ↓
Eleventy builds the static site
    ↓
Cloudflare Pages deploys it
    ↓
yourdomain.bloob.haus
```

When you push to your content repo, Cloudflare rebuilds the site automatically. When you push to this repo (the builder), all sites rebuild.

## Technical quick start

```bash
npm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local  # add your GITHUB_TOKEN

npm run dev:marbles    # dev server for marbles site
npm run dev:buffbaby   # dev server for buffbaby site
npm run build          # full build (defaults to buffbaby)
npm test               # run the test suite
```

### Fast single-file iteration

A full dev build preprocesses every file in the vault, which is slow for debugging one page. Pass `--page=<path>` (relative to the content repo) to any `dev:*` command to preprocess **only that file** — much faster when iterating on a layout, visualizer, or frontmatter behavior:

```bash
npm run dev:marbles -- --page=marbles/RADICALNESS.md
npm run dev:melt    -- --page=what-is-melt.md
```

(Note the `--` before `--page`, required so npm forwards the flag to the script.)

Site configs live in `sites/*.yaml`. Themes live in `themes/`. Content stays in its own private repo — this builder just reads it.

### Adding a new site
1. Create `sites/my-site.yaml` pointing to a content repo and a theme
2. Create `themes/my-theme/` with layouts, partials, and CSS
3. `SITE_NAME=my-site npm run build`
