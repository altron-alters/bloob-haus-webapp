Close out this work session. Keep updates concise — these docs should be easy to scan, not exhaustive.

1. Run `npm test` from bloob-haus-webapp/ and report results. Flag failures.

2. Add a short entry to `bloob-haus-webapp/docs/CHANGELOG.md`:
   - One sentence per major thing built or fixed
   - Note anything left incomplete
   - Keep it under ~15 lines

3. Update `bloob-haus-webapp/docs/CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md` only if the project status or "what's working" list meaningfully changed.

4. Add to `bloob-haus-webapp/docs/implementation-plans/DECISIONS.md` only if a genuinely architectural decision was made — something future-Claude needs to know *why* a thing works the way it does. Skip implementation details.

5. If new technical debt was introduced, add it to `bloob-haus-webapp/docs/TECH-DEBT.md`.

6. Update `docs/next-steps.md` at the project root — move completed items to "What's Done", update "Immediate Next Steps".

7. Commit and push `bloob-haus-webapp/` only. Write a clear commit message. Report the result.
